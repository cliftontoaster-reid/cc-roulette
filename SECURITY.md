# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Security vulnerabilities should be reported directly to the project team through private channels:

- **Developer**:
  - Discord: [Discord User](https://discord.com/users/571975224803721226)
  - Email: <cliftontreid@duck.com>

- **Code Owner**:
  - Discord: [Discord User](https://discord.com/users/969757574121529454)

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

- Confirm receipt of the vulnerability report within 48 hours
- Investigate and validate the reported issue
- Fix the vulnerability before any public disclosure
- Notify users about any security incidents within 48 hours of discovery in the case of a data breach

## Security Expectations

- All security discussions must remain private until resolution
- Public disclosure of vulnerabilities before they are fixed is prohibited
- We appreciate your help in keeping our users safe by following responsible disclosure practices
